# Update Documentation

Review recent code changes and update ALL relevant documentation in the `/docs` folder.

## Steps

1. **Read today's edit history**

   - Check `docs/edit-history/` for the current date's session file
   - Identify all files that were modified

2. **Analyze changes**

   - Read the modified files to understand what changed
   - Categorize changes: new features, bug fixes, architecture changes, API changes, config changes

3. **Update edit-history session file**

   - Add a summary section at the top describing what was accomplished
   - Group related changes under descriptive headings
   - Add any missing context about why changes were made

4. **Update CLAUDE.md if needed**

   - New commands or scripts added
   - Architecture or key modules changed
   - New environment variables required
   - New routes or endpoints added

5. **Update docs/README.md if needed**

   - New features or capabilities
   - Changed setup instructions
   - Updated project overview

6. **Update docs/ files**
   Review and update all architecture documentation to match current implementation

   **For each doc:**

   - Check if documented features match actual code implementation
   - Update outdated sections to reflect current code
   - Add NEW sections for features that are implemented but not documented
   - Remove or mark deprecated features that no longer exist
   - Ensure code examples match actual implementation

7. **Create new docs if needed**

   - If a significant new feature or module was added but has no documentation, create appropriate documentation
   - Follow existing documentation style and structure

8. **Report summary**
   - List all documentation files updated
   - Note any new documentation files created
   - Summarize key changes documented
